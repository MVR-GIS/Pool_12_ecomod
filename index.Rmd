# Introduction
This document describes the methods used for ecological modeling on this project. 

**Getting Started** 

-  Explore the project and study area using the links below.
-  Read the scoping section to understand the rationale governing this modeling effort. 
-  Use the top menu "Data Prep" to explore how the model inputs were developed for each model.
-  Use the top menu "Models" to explore how each model was configured and for results. 
-  Use the top menu "Alternatives" to explore how model results compare by alternative.

# Approach
Most of the ecological modeling done for USACE feasibility studies uses the ubiquitous spreadsheet because so many staffers know how to use this tool. However, spreadsheets are not necessarily the best tool for chaining models together, reproducing the analysis, visualizing results and communicating findings. 

This project applies many geospatial data science best practices to streamline ecological modeling [@gandrud_reproducible_2020; @r_core_team_r_2022; @rstudio_team_rstudio_2022; @wickham_welcome_2019, @pebesma_simple_2018].

# Scoping Questions
This section will pose a series of prompting questions for Project Delivery Team (PDT) members to consider when scoping a feasibility study modeling effort. These questions are designed to meet the following goals:

  - Ensure this modeling effort meets the goals of the project. 
  - Find the right level of modeling effort that matches project budget and timeline. 
  - Provide modelers with the details needed to build, run, and use the models for project decision making.

The PDT will provide specific answers to these general questions to help capture their rationale chosen for the ecological modeling portion of this study. This recording of the PDT's answers to these questions serves as a decision log for the modeling effort to help keep it on track. 


## What decisions will the models support? 
The purpose of this question is to establish the purpose and role the models must serve to complete the feasibility study. 

  **Answer:**
  
  -  Confirm decisions at the Tentatively Selected Plan (TSP) project phase. 
  -  Document benefits for the final feasibility report. 

## What models will describe project benefits?
What existing models capture the benefits of this project? 

  **Answer:**

  -  Forest Floodplain Model [@noauthor_upper_2021]
  -  Belted Kingfisher [@prose_habitat_1985]
  -  Marsh Wren [@gutzwiller_habitat_1987]

## How will alternatives be evaluated? 
How will model results will be used to make project decisions? How will project alternatives be compared? 

  **Answer:**



## How much do conditions vary across the study area?
How should the study area be subdivided for analysis? Can the study area be considered as a whole or subdivided into sections? Does the continuous variation of habitat conditions across the study need to be considered? 

  **Answer:**

  -  Floodplain Forest - Forest Management Geodatabase (FMG) Units will be the spatial unit of analysis for the forestry model.
  -  Kingfisher - 
  -  Marsh Wren - 

## What seasonality needs to be considered?
Does seasonality need to be considered? If so, what time periods within a year should be considered?

  **Answer:**

  -  Floodplain Forest - Seasonality does not need to be considered for forest communities. 
  -  Kingfisher - 
  -  Marsh Wren - 

## What period of analysis needs to be considered?
Over what length of time are project benefits being modeled? Do some measures start producing benefits earlier than others? If so, what time periods need to be modeled?

  **Answer:**

  -  Floodplain Forest - 
  -  Kingfisher - 
  -  Marsh Wren - 

## What data sources will be used?
What existing data exists for model input? Does new data need to be collected?

  **Answer:**

  -  Floodplain Forest - Existing FMG data will be summarized for model input.
  -  Kingfisher - 
  -  Marsh Wren - 

## How much model detail is needed to make decisions? 
What level of input data resolution is necessary to make decisions in this project? Is more recent input data needed or can existing data answer the questions?

  **Answer:**

  -  Floodplain Forest - Existing FMG forest survey data is current enough for this study.
  -  Kingfisher - 
  -  Marsh Wren - 

## What will be the timeline for analysis?
When are model results needed to support specific decisions required in the feasibility study.

  **Answer:**

  -  Floodplain Forest model results will be used to formulate measures.
  -  Calculate benefits for TSP. 
  -  Final benefits documentation for report. 

## What disciplines will be needed?
What staff will be required to support analysis of each model throughout the feasibility study? Are they available? What level of effort will be required of them and at which stage of the project? 

  **Answer:**

  -  Floodplain Forest - Biologist (model formulation), GIS (data prep), Foresters (forestry;)
  -  Kingfisher - Biologist (model formulation)
  -  Marsh Wren - Biologist (model formulation)
